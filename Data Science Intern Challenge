Question 1:

Part (a) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.

Answer: Average Order Value(AOV) is calculated as Revenue or Sales per Number of Orders. In this case, it seems like as if AOV was calculated as Revenue or sales per customer.
                    
 AOV in given example is calculated as (Revenue or Sales) /(Number of customers) = 15725640/5000 = 3145.13 


Part (b) what metric would you report for this dataset?

Answer: In order to calculate AOV correctly, we will use the correct formula of AOV :

AOV  =  (Revenue or Sales) /(Number of orders) = 15725640/43936 = 357.92

Part (c) what is its value ?

Answer: Hence, the correct AOV value is $ 357.92.




CODE for Question 1 in Python:

import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\deepa\Downloads\excel.xlsx')#please use the correct path for excel sheet

# this is the wrong calculation method for AOV
Order_A = data['order_amount'].sum()
Total_I = data['total_items'].count()
Wrong_AOV = Order_A/Total_I

print("The Incorrect Average Order Value is $ %.2f" % Wrong_AOV)

#the correct method for Calculating AOV is as follows
Order_Amount = data['order_amount'].sum()
Total_Items = data['total_items'].sum()
Correct_AOV = Order_Amount/Total_Items

print("The CORRECT Average Order Value is $ %.2f" % Correct_AOV)


Question 2:

a.How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
